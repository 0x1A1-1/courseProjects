Question - demo.c shows us that if a program is stuck in an infinite loop, it cannot go forward. Our program for a simple alarm (intdate.c) also has an infinite while loop. Yet, we see the print statements like below when we execute it -

% intdate
Date will be printed every 3 seconds.
Enter ^C to end the program:
current time is Tue Sep  4 13:15:21 2015
current time is Tue Sep  4 13:15:24 2015
current time is Tue Sep  4 13:15:27 2015
^C

How does the main function of intdate.c come out of the infinite while loop to print these statement?
Because we defined sigaction which make program jump to signal handler whenever there is a signal. The alarms go off every 3 second and a SIGALRM is caught by the handler. Inside the handler is the print statement thus the program is able to print those statements.
