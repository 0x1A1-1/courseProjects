Question - demo.c shows us that if a program is stuck in an infinite loop, it cannot go forward. Our program for a simple alarm (intdate.c) also has an infinite while loop. Yet, we see the print statements like below when we execute it -

% intdate
Date will be printed every 3 seconds.
Enter ^C to end the program:
current time is Tue Sep  4 13:15:21 2015
current time is Tue Sep  4 13:15:24 2015
current time is Tue Sep  4 13:15:27 2015
^C

How does the main function of intdate.c come out of the infinite while loop to print these statement?
