why have procedures?
  -- reuse of code simplifies program writing
  -- modular code facilitates modification
  -- allows different programmers to write different parts of the
     same program
  -- etc.

Assembly languages typically provide little or no support for
  procedure implementation.

So, we get to build a mechanism for implementing procedures out
of what we already know.


BEGIN WARNING {

   These notes first give concepts behind procedure linkage

   Near the end, we give the precise MIPS/354 conventions we use

   When writing programs, use the MIPS/354 conventions

   This will make more sense later

First, some terms and what we need.

In Pascal:

      begin
	.
	.
	.
       x := larger(a, b);      CALL
	.
	.
	.
      end.
                  HEADER     PARAMETERS
      function larger (one, two: integer): integer;
      begin
	 if ( one > two ) then
	   larger := one             BODY
	 else
	   larger := two
      end;

In C:

      {
	.
	.
	.
       x = larger(a, b);      CALL
	.
	.
	.
      }
               HEADER     PARAMETERS
      int larger (int one, int two)
      {
	 if ( one > two )
	   larger = one;             BODY
	 else
	   larger = two;
      }



Steps in the execution of the procedure:
    1. save return address
    2. procedure call
    3. execute procedure
    4. return


   what is return address?        instruction following call

   what is procedure call?        jump or branch to first instruction
				  in the procedure

   what is return?                jump or branch to return address


MAL implementation of SAL procedure call:


	   la  $8, rtn1
	   b proc1                 # one procedure call
     rtn1: # next instruction here
	    .
	    .
	    .
	   la  $8, rtn2
	   b proc1                 # another procedure call
     rtn2: # next instruction here

	    .
	    .
	    .

   proc1:    # 1st instruction of procedure here
	     .
	     .
	     .
	     jr $8


jr (jump register) is a new instruction --
      It does an unconditional branch (jump, actually) to the address
      contained in the register specified.






The MIPS R2000 architecture (MAL) provides a convenient instruction
for procedure calls.  
	    jal  procname

    does 2 things
     1.  it places the address of the instruction following it
	 into register $ra ($31).  (The choice of 31 is arbitrary, but
	 fixed.)
     2.  it branches (jumps) to the address given by the label (procname).




the example re-written:


             jal proc1   # use of $ra is implied
	     .
	     .
	     .
	     jal proc1
	     .
	     .
	     .


   proc1:    # 1st instruction of procedure here
	     .
	     .
	     .
	     jr $ra   # $ra is the alias for $31




one problem with this scheme.  What happens if a procedure
calls itself (recursion), or if a procedure calls another
procedure (nesting) (using jal)?

Here is sample code for this problematic case:

             jal proc1
	     .
	     .
	     .
	     jal proc1
	     .
	     .
	     .


   proc1:    .
	     .
	     jal proc2
	     .
	     .
	     jr  $ra


   proc2:    .
	     .
	     .
	     jr  $ra
 


       The value in register $ra ($31) gets overwritten with each
       jal instruction.  Return addresses are lost.  This
       is an unrecoverable error!


What is needed to handle this problem is to have a way to
save return addresses as they are generated.  For a recursive
subroutine, it is not known ahead of time how many times
the subroutine will be called.  This data is generated
dynamically; while the program is running.

These return addresses will need to be used (for returning)
in the reverse order that they are saved.

The best way to save dynamically generated data that is needed
in the reverse order it is generated is on a STACK.




SYSTEM STACK
------------
  A stack is so frequently used in implementing procedure call/return,
  that many (most?) computer systems predefine a stack, the SYSTEM STACK.


  STATIC -- can be defined when program is written (compile time)
  DYNAMIC -- is defined when a program is executed (run time)

      In this case, it is the amount of storage that cannot be
      determined until run time.

  The size of the system stack is very large.  In theory, it should
  be infinitely large.  In practice, it must have a size limit.

  on the MIPS architecture:

 address  |         |
    0     | your    |
          | program |
          | here    |
          |         |
          |         |
          |         |
          |         |
          |         |
          | system  |  / \
  very    | stack   |   |  grows towards smaller addresses
 large    | here    |   |
 addresses



    terminology:

       Some people say that this stack grows DOWN in memory.
       This means that the stack grows towards smaller memory
       addresses.  Their picture would show address 0 at the
       bottom (unlike my picture).

       DOWN and UP are vague terms, unless you know what the
       picture looks like.

 The MIPS system stack is defined to grow towards smaller
 addresses, and the stack pointer points to an empty location
 (the next available) at the top of the stack.  The stack pointer
 is register $29, also called $sp, and it is defined before program
 execution begins.


 push, in MAL:

    sw   $?, ($sp)       # the ? is replaced by whateger register
    sub  $sp, $sp, 4     # contains the data to be pushed.

       OR

    sub  $sp, $sp, 4     # a "better" implementation, since it allocates
    sw   $?, 4($sp)      # the space before using the space.

 pop, in MAL:
   
    add $sp, $sp, 4    # the ? is replace by a register number
    lw  $?, ($sp)

       OR

    lw  $?, 4($sp)       # a "better" implementation, since it copies
    add $sp, $sp, 4      # the data out before deallocating the space


  NOTE:  if $sp ($29) is used for any other purpose, then the stack pointer
         is lost.



An example of using the system stack to save return addresses:

     jal doit
     .
     .
     .
     jal doit
     .
     .
     .

doit: 
       sub $sp, $sp, 4     # save return address
       sw  $ra, 4($sp)

      .
      .
      .
       jal another         # this would overwrite the return
                           # address if it had not been saved.
      .
      .
      .

       lw  $ra, 4($sp)      # restore return address
       add $sp, $sp, 4
       jr  $ra



about STACK FRAMES (ACTIVATION RECORDS)
---------------------------------------

From a compiler's point of view, there are a bunch of things
that should go on the stack relating to procedure call/return.
They include:
     return address (register)
     parameters
     other various registers

Each procedure has different requirements for numbers of
  parameters, their size, and how many registers (which ones)
  will need to be saved on the stack.  So, we compose a
  STACK FRAME or ACTIVATION RECORD that is specific to a
  procedure.


Space for a stack frame gets allocated on the stack each time
a procedure is called, and taken off the stack each time a
return occurs.  These stack frames are pushed/popped
DYNAMICALLY (while the program is running).


example:
  jal  A
  jal  B
  .
  .

A:  jal C
    jal D
    jr $ra

B:  jal D
    jr $ra

C:  jal E
    jr $ra

D:  jr $ra

E:  jr $ra


              show stack for a trace through this calling sequence




The code (skeleton) for one of these procedures:

A:  sub $sp, $sp, 20     # allocate frame for A
    sw  $ra, 16($sp)     # save A's return address

    jal C
    jal D

    lw  $ra, 16($sp)     # restore A's return address
    add $sp, $sp, 20     # remove A's frame from stack
    jr $ra               # return from A




Some notes on this:
-- the allocation and removal of a frame should be done within
   the body of the procedure.  That way, the compiler does not
   need to know the size of a procedure's frame (when producing
   the code where the call is).
-- Accesses to A's frame are done via offsets from the stack pointer.



parameter passing.
------------------

parameter = argument

Just as there is little/no support for implementing procedures
in many assembly languages, there is little/no support for passing
parameters to those procedures.

Remember, when it comes to the implementation,
	 --  convention
	 --  its up to the programmer to follow the conventions



Passing parameters means getting data into a place set aside
for the parameters.  Both the calling program and the procedure
need to know where the parameters are.

	The calling program places them there, and possibly uses
	values returned by the procedure.  The procedure uses
	the parameters.


a note on parameter passing --
  a HLL specifies rules for passing parameters.  There are basically
  2 types of parameters.

  Note that a language can offer 1 or both types.

    call by value -- what C has.  In Pascal, these are parameters
	declared without the 'var' in front of the variable name.
	Fortran doesn't offer this type of parameter.

	The parameter passed may not be modified by the procedure.
	This can be implemented by passing a copy of the value.
	What call by value really implies is that the procedure can
	modify the value (copy) passed to it, but that the value
	is not changed outside the scope of the procedure.

    call by reference -- what Fortran has.  In Pascal, these are
        "var type" parameters.  C does not offer this type of
	parameter.

	The parameter passed to the subroutine can be modified,
	and the modification is seen outside the scope of the
	subroutine.  It is sort of like having access to global
	variable.


There are many ways of implementing these 2 variable types.
If call by value is the only parameter type allowed, how
can we implement a reference type parameter?
   Pass the address of the variable as the parameter.  Then
   access to the variable is made through its address.



Simplest mechanism -- registers
-------------------------------

the calling program puts the parameter(s) into specific registers,
and the procedure uses them.

  example:

	     .
	     .
	     .
	move  $4, $20         # put parameter in register 4
	jal   decrement
	move  $20, $4         # recopy parameter to its correct place.
	     .
	     .
	     .
   decrement:   add  $4, $4, -1
		jr $ra


Notes:   -- This is a trivial example, since the procedure is 1 line
	    long.
	 -- Why not just use $20 within the procedure?
		1. convention -- parameters are passed in specific registers.
                2. same procedure could be used to decrement the value
		   in other registers -- just copy the value to register $4
		   first, and copy it out afterwards.


historically more significant mechanism:  parameters on stack
					 ---------------------

Place the parameters to a procedure (function) on the stack.
The parameters go between the caller and callee's AR.

       sub $sp, $sp, 8   # allocate space for parameters
       sw  $9, 8($sp)    # place parameter 1 into AR of proc
       sw  $18, 4($sp)   # place parameter 2 into AR of proc
       jal proc
       add $sp, $sp, 8   # deallocate space for parameters
       .
       .
       .
    proc:
       sub $sp, $sp, 12  # allocate remainder of AR for proc
		         # assume fixed size (too big) activation record
       lw  $10, 20($sp)  # retrieve parameter 1 for use
       lw  $11, 16($sp)  # retrieve parameter 2

                         # use parameters in procedure calculations

       add $sp, $sp, 12  # remove AR of proc
       jr  $ra




calling program:  allocates space for parameters
		  places parameters into stack
		  calls procedure
		  deallocates space for parameters (when appropriate)

procedure:        allocates AR (or remainder of AR)
		  deallocates AR of procedure



MIPS convention -- when passing parameters in registers,
the first 4 parameters are passed in registers $4-7.
The alias for $4-$7 is $a0-$a3.  The first parameter to a
procedure is always passed in $a0.
  Then, ANY and ALL procedures use those registers for their parameters.

ALSO MIPS convention -- space for all parameters (passed in
$a0-a3) is allocated in the caller's AR !!

If there are nested subroutine calls, and registers $a0-a3 are
used for parameters, the values would be lost (just like the
return address would be lost for  'jal' if not saved).
  An example of this problem:
  
   procA:  # receives 3 parameters is in $a0, $a1, and $a2

         # set up procB's parameters
         move $a0, $24  # overwrites procA's parameter in $a0
         move $a1, $9   # overwrites procA's parameter in $a1
         jal  procB     # the nested procedure call

         # procA continues after procB returns
         # procA's parameters are needed, but have been overwritten

There are 2 possible solutions.

  1.  (works for non-recursive nested calls) each procedure has associated
  with it a section of memory.  Before a nested call is made,
  the current parameters are stored in that memory.  After the return
  from the nested call, the current values are restored.

  2.  (works for any nested calls, even for recursive calls)
  current parameters are stored on the stack before
  a nested call.   After the return from the nested call, the
  current parameters are restored.



The example re-written, to do things the MIPS way.  Note that this is
only a code fragment. It does not show everything (like saving $ra).

   procA:  # receives 3 parameters is in $a0, $a1, and $a2.
           # The caller of procA has allocated space for $a0-$a3
	   # at the top of the stack.

	   # assume that procA has an activation record of 5 words.
         sub  $sp, $sp, 20   # allocate space for AR

         # save procA's parameters
	 sw   $a0, 24($sp)
	 sw   $a1, 28($sp)
	 sw   $a2, 32($sp)
         # set up procB's parameters
         move $a0, $24 
         move $a1, $9 
         jal  procB     # the nested procedure call

         # procA continues after procB returns
         # procA's parameters are needed, so restore them
	 lw   $a0, 24($sp)
	 lw   $a1, 28($sp)


  In this code fragment,  procA saves its 3rd parameter (from $a2)
  on the stack.  Is this necessary (given that procB only receives
  2 parameters)?  Why or why not?


  here's a general layout of how this second option is used
  on MIPS, following conventions (with 4 or fewer parameters):

	proc1 layout:
	    allocate AR (include space for outgoing parameters) 
	    put return address on stack into AR of procedure

	    procedure calculations

	    to set up and call proc2,
	       place current parameters (from $a0-a3) into previously allocated
	           space
	       set up parameters to proc2 in $a0-a3
	       call proc2 (jal proc2)
	       copy any return values out of $v0-v1, $a0-a3
	       restore current parameters back to $a0-a3

	    more procedure calculations (presumably using procedure's
	      parameters which are now back in $a0-a3)

	    get procedure's return address from AR
	    deallocate AR
	    return (jr $ra)


	       

Summary and other ideas:
 1.  use registers 
     + easy, and don't have to store data in memory (faster)
     - limited number of registers
     - doesn't work for recursion, and must be careful when 
       using it where there are nested subroutines
 2. use some registers, and place the rest on the stack
     + since many procedures have few parameters, get the advantages
       of (1) most of the time.
     - lots of "data shuffling"
 3. put all parameters on the stack (an unsophisticated compiler might
    do this)
     + simple, clean method (easy to implement)
     - lots of stack operations (meaning slow, since the stack is in
       memory)
 4. put parameters in memory set aside for them
     + simple, clean method
     - lots of memory operations (slow)
     - doesn't work for recursion

Note: whatever you do, try to be consistant.  Don't use all 4 methods
      in the same program.  (Its poor style.)





about frame pointers
      --------------


The stack gets used for more than just pushing/popping stack frames.
During the execution of a procedure, there may be a need for temporary
storage of variables.  The common example of this is in expression
evaluation.
 Example:      high level language statement
		 Z = (X * Y) + (A/2) - 100
   The intermediate values of X*Y and A/2 must be stored somewhere.
On older machines, register space was at a premium.  There just weren't
enough registers to be used for this sort of thing.  So, intermediate
results (local variables) were stored on the stack.

They don't go in the stack frame of the executing procedure; they
are pushed/popped onto the stack as needed.


So, at one point in a procedure, parameter 2 might be at 16($sp)


  |       |
  ---------
  |       |<- $sp
  ---------
  |       | ---
  ---------   |
  |       |   |
  ---------   |
  |       | ------ procedure's frame
  ---------    
  |param 2|    
  ---------    
  |       |    
  ---------    
  |       |
  ---------


and, at another point within the same procedure, parameter 2 might be
at 24($sp)

  ---------
  |       |<- $sp
  ---------
  | temp2 |
  ---------
  | temp1 |
  ---------
  |       | ---
  ---------   |
  |       |   |
  ---------   |
  |       | ------ procedure's frame
  ---------    
  |param 2|    
  ---------    
  |       |    
  ---------    
  |       |
  ---------



All this is motivation for keeping an extra pointer around that does
not move with respect to the current stack frame.  

Call it a FRAME POINTER.  Make it point to the base of the current
frame:

  ---------
  |       |<- $sp
  ---------
  | temp2 |
  ---------
  | temp1 |
  ---------
  |       | ---
  ---------   |-- procedure's frame
  |       |   |
  ---------   |
  |       | ---   <-- frame pointer
  ---------    
  |param 2|    
  ---------    
  |       |
  ---------
  |       |
  ---------

Now items within the frame can be accessed with offsets from the
frame pointer, AND the offsets do not change within the procedure.


parameter 2 will be at  4(frame pointer)
A new register is needed for this frame pointer.  Pick one.
(The chapter arbitrarily chooses $16, but it could be any register.)

parameter 2 is at  4($16)



NOTE:  

 -- The frame pointer must be initialized at the start of
every procedure, and restored at the end of every procedure.
 -- The MIPS architecture doesn't really allocate a register for a
frame pointer.  It has something else that it calls a "virtual frame
pointer," but it isn't really the same as described here.  On the
MIPS, all data with a stack frame is accessed via the stack pointer, $sp.


The skeleton of a procedure that uses a frame pointer and
has parameters:

  # the frame (AR) is 4 words, 2 words are space for 2 parameters
  # passed in $a0 and $a1, 1 is for return address, and 1 is for
  # the frame pointer

  procedure:
    sub  $sp, $sp, 8   # allocate remainder of frame
                       # (assumes that caller allocated space for the
                       # 2 parameters)
    sw   $ra, 8($sp)   # save procedure's return address
    sw   $16, 4($sp)   # save caller's frame pointer
    add  $16, $sp, 8  # set procedure's frame pointer


    # procedure's code in here
    # Note that all accesses to procedure's AR is done with offsets from $16

    lw   $ra, ($16)    # restore return address
    move $8, $16       # save frame pointer temporarily
    lw   $16, -4($16)  # restore callers frame pointer
    move $sp, $8       # remove procedure's frame (AR)
    jr   $ra



the activation record (frame) for this procedure after everything
is in it:

                     ^ smaller addresses up here
  |----------------|
  |                |<--- $sp
  |----------------|
  | frame pointer  |
  |----------------|
  | return address | <--- $16 (frame pointer)
  |----------------|
  | space for P2   |
  |----------------|
  | space for P1   |

New problem:
  What happens if you've got lots of variables, and your procedure
  runs out of registers to put them in.  This occurs when you are
  following the conventions for register usage, and you shouldn't
  overwrite the values in certain registers.

  Most common solution:  store register values temporarily on the
                         stack in AR.


Two types:

CALLEE SAVED
   a procedure clears out some registers for its own use

   register values are preserved across procedure calls

   MIPS calls these SAVED registers, and designates $s0-s8 for this
   useage.

   $s0-$s8 are aliases for $16-$23, $30

   the called procedure saves register values in its AR,
     uses the registers for local variables,
       restores register values before it returns.


CALLER SAVED
   the calling program saves the registers that it does not want a
    called procedure to overwrite

   register values are NOT preserved across procedure calls

   MIPS calls these TEMPORARY registers, and designates $t0-t9 for this
   useage.

   $t0-$t9 are aliases for $8-15, $24-$25

   procedures use these registers for local variables, because
     the values do not need to be preserved outside the scope
     of the procedure.






what the mechanisms should look like from the compiler's
point of view:


THE CODE:

   call setup
   procedure call
   return cleanup
   .
   .
   .
procedure:  prologue

            calculations

            epilogue



CALL SETUP
  place current parameters into stack (space already allocated by
    caller of this procedure)
  save any TEMPORARY registers that need to be preserved across the
     procedure call
  place first 4 parameters to procedure into $a0-$a3
  place remainder of parameters to procedure into allocated space
     within the stack frame



PROLOGUE
  allocate space for stack frame
  save return address in stack frame
  copy needed parameters from stack frame into registers
  save any needed SAVED registers into current stack frame


EPILOGUE

  restore (copy) return address from stack frame into $ra
  restore from stack frame any saved registers (saved in prologue)
  de-allocate stack frame
     (move $sp so the space for the procedure's frame is gone)


RETURN CLEANUP
  copy needed return values and parameters from $v0-v1, $a0-a3, or stack
     frame to correct places
  restore any temporary registers from stack frame (saved in call setup)

An important detail for 354 students writing MAL code and using
the simulator:
   The I/O instructions  putc, puts, and getc are implemented
   as functions within the operating system.  They are not
   actual instructions on a MIPS R2000 processor. (In general,
   NO modern architecture has explicit input/output instructions.)

   Parameters get passed to the operating system, and return values
   get set by the functions implementing putc, puts, and getc.
   Therefore, in general, you must assume that $a0-$a3 and $v0-$v1
   will be overwritten during the execution of any putc, puts, or
   getc instruction.

   In practice, I believe the simulator is implemented to only
   change values in $a0 and $v0.



Functions
---------
Functions are just procedures that return a value.

For Java programmers, functions are methods.

A function sets a return value, and this return value is available
(set) after the function returns.  So, a return value is similar to
a parameter, only the flow of information is the reverse.

The location of a function return value follows the same rules
as the location of parameters.  We could place a function return
value
  1.  in a register
  2.  on the stack
      The caller would allocate space for both outgoing parameters
      AND return values in its activation record.  The function
      places the return value into this allocated space.
      The caller then has the return value in this allocated 
      space.
  3.  in a set-aside memory location (not on the stack)
      Just like for parameters, this location for a return value
      will not work for a recursive function.

The MIPS architecture specifies that a return value is placed
into a register.  In fact, there are two registers set aside
for this purpose:

        $2  is also called $v0
	and
	$3  is also called $v1

an example code fragment:

             jal  function1      # y = function1();
             sw   $v0, y
             .
             .
             .
 function1:  # the function does calculations
             .
             .
             .
	     # and then sets the return value
	     move $v0, $t0       # the return value was in $t0
	     jr   $ra






some guidelines:

 -- if parameters passed on stack, want them "between" caller and
    callee's activation records.

 -- use of frame pointer can reduce amount of code.  It gives a better
    level of abstraction.

 -- depending on conventions and implementations, the amount of
    space allocated for activation record may be different than
    the amount of space removed.
	
	If callee allocates space, and parameters are on stack.

	If caller and callee each allocate some of the space.

 -- MIPS:
      always allocate space in activation record for all parameter
      registers, even if there are fewer than 4 parameters.
