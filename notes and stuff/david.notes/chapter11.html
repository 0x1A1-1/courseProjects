I/O (w/o interrupts)
--------------------

We modeled a computer as (show w/o i/o first):

      
       -----        --------
       |CPU| <----> |memory|
       -----   ^    --------
	       |
	       |
	      \ /

	     -----
	     |i/o|
	     -----

To be useful computers must communication with outside world

	input:  get data in
		from keyboards, mice, disks, networks, microphones...

	output: get data out
		to displays, printers, disks, networks, speakers...

	called I/O (input/output)


There example devices

Keyboard
	user presses A key ==> 'a' (ASCII 0x61 == 01100001)
	user presses Shift and A ==> 'A' (ASCII 0x41)
	user presses Return = > 'cr' (ASCII 0x0d)

	Keyboard send on wire 1==start, 8-bit data, 0==stop
	E.g. for 'a'   1011000010
	Buffer at computer catches these bits

Displays
	Character display work with the reverve process (sort of)
	Most displays today are "bit mapped" and work more like TVs

Hard Disk -- A spinning disk (like a record or CD)
	2-4 GB today
	But
		magnetic and read/write (like tape)
		use both sides
		may have a stack of platters

	disk access:  queueing + seek + rotation + transfer
		       depends	 10 ms    10 ms     1 ms

	Electronic ==> ns = 10^-9 s   
	Mechanical ==> ms = 10^-3 s  a million times slower!


Problems
	How does CPU ask for a char to be printed?
	Which printer?  which display (mine or yours?)

	When is printer ready for the next char?
	When does keyboard have the next char?

	What about the million times slower?



Users see
	get, getc, put, putc, puts

Simulator only support input from one keyboard and output
to one display

To hide details from users and to protect users from each other
many systems manage details of I/O in the operating system

"putc char" is really

	lb $4, char	# $4 char to be printed
	li $2, 11	# li + syscall == jal operating_system_function_11
	syscall

"getc char" is

	li $2, 12	# li + syscall == jal operating_system_function_12
	syscall
	sb $2, char	# returns with char read in $2

We don't use jal because
	OS doesn't trust user to provide the correct address
	Want to switch into OS mode, where more things are allowed

OS catches syscall and uses value is $2 to determine what to do
(like a case statement)



OS will not allow
	users to read each other's keyboards
	users to send infinite jobs to printers

But how does the OS do I/O?

What instruction causes an I/O (e.g., print a char)?

	could have special instructions --
		but hard to anticipate all possibilties

	solution:  overload memory and loads and stores

Called memory-mapped I/O (I made up the specific addresses used below.)

	 0x00000000	+-----+   Real memory
			|     |
			|     |
			|     |
			|     |
			|     |
			|     |
	 0xffff0000	+-----+

	 0xffff0008     <============ from keyboard


	 0xffff0010     ============> to display


Set label KeyboardData to 0xffff0008
	  DisplayData  to 0xffff0010


Implementation Pix:

	CPU	Mem	
	 |       |
	 +=======+=====+==================+
		       |		  |
		 ==0xffff0008?	   ==0xffff0010?
		 keyboard buffer   display buffer

(Other keyboards, displays, and I/O devices can be mapped as other addresses.)


operating_system_function_12:	# getc char and put it in $2
	
	lw  $2, KeyboardData
	"return from syscall"


operating_system_function_11:	# putc char, where char is in $4
	
	sw  $2, DisplayData
	"return from syscall"

But is there a new char to read?
But is the display (printer) done with the last char?



Need I/O device "status" to coordinate (synchronize)

Special instrns?  No ==> memory map it

	 0x00000000	+-----+   Real memory
			|     |
			|     |
			|     |
			|     |

	 0xffff0000	+-----+

	 0xffff0008     <============ DATA from keyboard 
	 0xffff000c     <============ STATUS from keyboard


	 0xffff0010     ============> to display
	 0xffff0014     <============ STATUS from display

Set label KeyboardStatus to 0xffff000c
          DisplayStatus  to 0xffff0014

Assume Status is word where MSB=1 (2SC word negative) implies ready
			    MSB=0 (2SC word non-negative) implies busy


operating_system_function_12:	# getc char and put it in $2

WaitLoop12: lw $14, KeyboardStatus
	bgez  $14, WaitLoop12	# keep waiting if $14 non-negative

	lw  $2, KeyboardData    # same as before
	"return from syscall"


operating_system_function_11:	# putc char, where char is in $4

WaitLoop11: lw $14, DisplayStatus
	bgez  $14, WaitLoop11	# keep waiting if $14 non-negative
	
	sw  $4, DisplayData	# same as before
	"return from syscall"

But how much of the time do we spend spinning?

We can putc or getc in much less than 100 instructions: 20 ns * 100 = 2 us

Mechanical devices take ms -- e.g. 20 ms = 20000 us

Therefore,	time waiting	      20000 us
		------------  =  ----------------  =  99.99% !!!!!
		total time	  20000 us + 2 us

But we don't have to busy wait (spin)



We could go back to the program, do useful work and periodically return
and deal with the next char

	printstring  -- enqueued a string for printing & returns
	printnextchar -- print next char (if any) and return

(Analogous scheme possible to getstring.)

Pseudo-code for (part of) example on page 301-302:

putqueue:  array[0..255] of char;
/*
** head put queue pointer (index): points just before valid data
*/
integer hpqp; /* initialized to 0 */
/*
** tail put queue pointer (index): points at last valid data
*/
integer tpqp; /* initialized to 0 */
/*
** note: hpqp = tpqp ==> put queue empty
*/

putstring(string)
/*
** If room avaiable in queue, string to it.
** Otherwise, return "overflow"
** May also print first char.
*/
<not shown>


putnextchar()
begin
	/*
	**  Is display ready?
	**
	**	yes ==> print a char (if any) & return
	**      no  ==> return
	*/
	if (DisplayStatus < 0)
	then begin
		/*
		** Return if queue empty
		*/
		if (hpqp != tpqp)
		then begin
			/*
			** Invariant: head ptr points just before valid data
			**
			** Update head ptr and print
			*/
			hpqp = (hpqp + 1) rem 256;
			DisplayData := putqueue[hpqp];
		end
	end
	return()
end


Do example on page 301-302....


  on DMA (Direct Memory Access)
---------------------------------

The scheme presented so far really only deals with transfers of a
single byte or word.  There are plenty of devices (networks, disks)
that transfer larger blocks of data.  These devices also tend to
operate much faster than the displays and keyboards and mice.

Having the OS spin wait, or even poll a high speed I/O device
(like a disk) would be really inefficent.  Spin waiting to transfer
a relatively large quantity of data ties up
the processor, and polling couldn't be done often enough to make
it efficient (for high-speed devices).

The solution desired will allow block transfers at the speed that
the device can handle.

  So, set up a simple computer (a controller) that can directly
  access main memory.


    -----------          -----------------           --------------
    |         |          |               |           |            |
    | disk    |<-------->|  controller   |<--------->| memory     |
    |         |          -----------------     / \   |            |
    |         |                                 |    |            |
    -----------                                 |    --------------
						|
					       \ /
                                         ---------------
					 |             |
					 | processor   |
					 |             |
                                         ---------------

The processor sets everything up for a DMA transfer.
It tells the controller
     a starting disk address
     a starting memory address
     # of bytes to transfer
And, then it tells the controller to do the transfer.
The controller does the tranfer (at the speed that the disk can handle).
The processor checks every once in a while to see if the tranfer
is complete.


An issue to ponder:
  While the disk is reading/writing memory, the processor cannot
  access memory.  How will the processor do anything productive
  if it cannot access memory?

  Solutions:
  -- set up a protocol for the access to memory.  Give the processor
     priority. -- NO
  -- design a memory that can handle 2 requests at the same time.
     (Note that this is not practical from a design standpoint.)
  -- don't worry about it, since the disk doesn't need every cycle
     of memory access time.  And, if the processor has a cache (ch. 13)
     the processor won't need much access to memory anyway.

  on polling
---------------

to make a system work, the OS will need to check regularly if
its devices have become ready.  This is called polling.

The OS runs at regular intervals (say, once per millisecond)
to check each device to see if it is ready.  If ready, then the
OS further deals with the device.
  For a keyboard, the character is placed into a queue.
  For a display, the queue is checked.  If not empty, then the next
    character in the queue is sent to the device.


Difficulties with this:

-- how often to get the OS to poll?
   Too little, and input devices may loose data.
   Too much, and lots of time is wasted checking devices when they are
   not yet ready.
-- How does the OS code get run?
   The user-level program shouldn't have the responsibility.  It has
   no notion of time.
   What happens to the user-level program while the OS is polling?


Transition for Chapter 12

    Why have SW repeatedly ask a device, "Are you ready?" (polling).
    Instead have device tell SW, "I am ready!" (interrupt)
