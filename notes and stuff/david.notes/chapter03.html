Intro
-----

(Applies to Chapter 4 as well.)

In the beginning people represented numbers with: /
	///////  is seven
	/////// + ///// = ////////////

Later:
	////\ // + ////\ = ////\ ////\ //
	VII + V = VVII = XII

We use:
	7 + 5 = 12 = 1*10 + 2 -- base ten -- because we have ten fingers



BIG CONCEPT (ignored in life but important for computers): 

Number representation vs. Number

There are many ways to "represent" a number (e.g., above)

Representation does not affect the result of an operation

	XII + XXXIII = XLV
	12 + 33 = 45

But representation affects difficulty
of computing result:

	XXXIII
       *   XII
        ------
	XXXIII
       XXXIII
      CCCXXX
      --------
      CCCXXXXXXXXXIIIIII
      CCCLXXXXVI
      CCCXCVI = 396

For computer we need to chose a representations that allows us
to build fast electronic circuits for computer (e.g., adding)

Since computer don't have fingers, they don't use base ten number

This chapter is a review of number systems

The next chapter applies the ideas to computers.



Representing positive integers: 1, 2, 3, ...

Big advance of humankind:  arabic numerals
"weighted position notation with base ten"

     345 is really
	  3 x 100   + 4 x 10    + 5 x 1
	  3 x 10**2  + 4 x 10**1  + 5 x 10**0
     3 is the most significant symbol (it carries the most weight)
     5 is the least significant symbol (it carries the least weight)

     digits (or symbols) allowed: 0-9
     base (or radix):  10


For computer binary number work great -- why? two-state devices

here's a binary number system:
     digits (symbols) allowed: 0, 1
     base (radix):  2


      1001 (base 2) is really
	   1 x 2**3  + 0 x 2**2  + 0 x 2**1  + 1 x 2**0
	   9 (base 10)

      11000 (base 2) is really
	   1 x 2**4  +  1 x 2**3  + 0 x 2**2  + 0 x 2**1  + 0 x 2**0
	   24 (base 10)


			20th C
	system	e.g.	humans	computers
	------	----	------	---------
	roman	XVIII	bad	bad
	arabic	18	good	bad
	binary	100010	bad	good

Humans might multiply romans numerals by converting to arabic, multiplying
and converting back

Computer usually multiply arabic numerals by converting to binary, multiplying
and converting back


Humans use octal or hex to read binary number (we'll see why when
we learn how to convert bases).

here's an octal number system:
     digits (symbols) allowed: 0-7
     base (radix):  8

     the order of the digits is significant

     345  (base 8) is really
	  3 x 8**2  + 4 x 8**1  + 5 x 8**0
	    192     +    32     +   5
	    229 (base 10)

      1001 (base 8) is really
	   1 x 8**3  + 0 x 8**2  + 0 x 8**1  + 1 x 8**0
	      512    +    0      +    0      +    1
	   513 (base 10)


here's a hexadecimal number system:
     digits (symbols) allowed: 0-9, a-f
     base (radix):  16

     hex   decimal
     0       0
     1       1
	  .
	  .
	  .
     9       9
     a       10
     b       11
     c       12
     d       13
     e       14
     f       15

     Why a-f?  Need six more symbols
     Could use heart, club, diamond, spade, square and triangle
     But a-f are on keyboard and it's easy to remember c is one bigger then b

     Note: English has a special symbol for twelve (not ten-ee-two)
	   like twenty-three

      a3 (base 16) is really
	   a x 16**1  + 3 x 16**0
	    160       +   3
	   163 (base 10)

      3e8 (base 16) is really
	   3 x 16**2 + e x 16**1  + 8 x 16**0
	   3 x 256   + 14 x 16    + 8 x 1
	    768      +   224      +   8
	   1000 (base 10)

      100 (base 16) is really
	   1 x 16**2 + 0 x 16**1  + 0 x 16**0
	   1 x 256   + 0 x 16     + 0 x 1
	    256      +   0        + 0
	   256 (base 10)




given all these examples, here's a set of formulas for the
  general case.

  here's a number (in weighted positional notation):

       S     S    .  .  .   S    S    S
        n-1   n-2            2    1    0
  
  given a base b, this is the decimal value


	  the summation (from i=0 to i=n-1) of S  x  b**i
						i



TRANSFORMATIONS BETWEEN BASES
-----------------------------

any base --> decimal
    just use the definition give above.


decimal --> binary

Two ways:
   (1) divide decimal value by 2 until the value is 0 (see book)
   (2) know your powers of two and subtract

Method (2):
	... 256	128  64	 32  16   8   4   2   1
	      d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d

E.g., 42
	What is the biggest power of two that fits? 32
	42-32 = 10

	What fits? 8
	10-8 = 2

	What fits? 2
	2-2 = 0 done!

	one 32, one 8, one 2
	one 32, zero 16, one 8, zero 4, one 2, zero 1
	 1       0        1       0       1     0
	 101010




binary --> octal
    1. group into 3's starting at least significant symbol
       (if the number of bits is not evenly divisible by 3, then
	add 0's at the most significant end)
    2. write 1 octal digit for each group

    example:
	
	100 010 111  (binary)
	 4   2   7   (octal)
	
	 10 101 110  (binary)
	 2   5   6   (octal)

binary --> hex
  (just like binary to octal!)
    1. group into 4's starting at least significant symbol
       (if the number of bits is not evenly divisible by 4, then
	add 0's at the most significant end)
    2. write 1 hex digit for each group


    example:
     
       1001 1110 0111 0000
	9    e    7    0

	  1 1111 1010 0011
	1    f    a    3


hex --> binary
     (trivial!)  just write down the 4 bit binary code for
     each hexadecimal digit

     example:

      3    9    c    8
    0011 1001 1100 1000


octal --> binary
     (just like hex to binary!)
     (trivial!)  just write down the 8 bit binary code for
     each octal digit


hex --> octal
     do it in 2 steps,       hex --> binary --> octal

decimal --> hex
     do it in 2 steps,       decimal --> binary --> hex

Explain why humans (make that computer scientists) use hex (or octal)
to read binary

	10110010  !=  10010010
	1011 0010     1001 0010
	   b 2           9 2

How many 1 bits in 178?   How in b2?  b has 3 + 2 has 1 = 4.




On zero and negative integers
-----------------------------

In any base b, zero is

      ...  + 0 x b**3  + 0 x b**2  + 0 x b**1  + 0 x b**0
		 0     +    0      +     0     +    0

		 0  (by convention only one zero)

Negative integers

	Most humans precede number with "-" (e.g., -2000)
	(Accountant, however, use parentheses:  (2000)

	Called signed-magnitude

        e.g., -1000 into hex?

	1000  = 3 x 16**2 + e x 16**1  + 8 x 16**0

	==> -3e8

	Computers, well see in Chapter 4, want to do it
	with just 0 and 1's, and not other symbols -,(,).


On "decimals"
-------------
	
	What is 3.14159?

	3 x 10**0 + 1 x 10**-1 + 4 x 10**-2 + 1 x 10**-3 + 5 x 10**-4 + 9 x 10**-5

	or

	3 x 10**0 + 1/10**1 + 4/10**2 + 1/10**3 + 5/10**4 + 9/10**5

	... +3 +2 +1 0 . -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 
		     3 .  1  4  1  5  9


        S    S    S     .    S     S     S
         2    1    0	      -1    -2    -3
  

	  the summation (i) of S  x  10**i
                                i

	In base ten, called "decimal"

	Can do in any base

	  the summation (i) of S  x  b**i
                                i

	E.g.,  3e.8f in hex is

	3 * 16**1 + 14 * 16**0 + 8 * 16**-1 + 15*16**-2
	  3*16    +    14      +    8/16    +  15/256 

               143
	= 62 & ---
	       256

	E.g., binary 10.101

	1 * 2**1 + 0 * 2**0 + 1 * 2**-1 + 0*2**-2 + 1*2**-3
	2 + 0 + 1/2 + 0/4 + 1/8
	2 5/8



on representing nonintegers
---------------------------

what range of values is needed for calculations
     very large:     Avogadro's number 6.022 x 10 ** 23 atoms/mole
		     mass of the earth 5.98 x 10 ** 24 kilograms
		     speed of light    3.0 x 10 ** 8 meters/sec
     very small:     charge on an electron -1.60 x 10 ** (-19)



scientific notation
    a way of representing rational numbers using integers
    (used commonly to represent nonintegers in computers)

                                     exponent
	    number =  mantissa x base
	

	mantissa == fraction == significand
	base == radix
	point is really called a radix point, for a number with
	 a decimal base, its called a decimal point.

	all the constants given above are in scientific notation



normalization
  to keep a unique form for every representable noninteger, they
  are kept in NORMAL form.  A number in normal form will follow the
  following rule:

	   1 <=  mantissa  <  base
  
  In the normal form the radix point is always placed one place to
  the right of the first significant symbol (as above).




BINARY FRACTIONS
----------------

       f     f    .  .  .   f    f    f  .  f    f    f  . . .
        n-1   n-2            2    1    0     -1   -2   -3
                                         |  
                                         |  
					  binary point

       The decimal value is calculated in the same way as for
       non-fractional numbers,  the exponents are now negative.




  example:
          101.001 (binary)
          1 x 2**2 + 1 x 2**0 + 1 x 2**-3
             4     +    1     +  1/8
                   5  1/8  = 5.125 (decimal)

  2**-1 = .5
  2**-2 = .25
  2**-3 = .125
  2**-4 = .0625   etc.

converting decimal to binary fractions

   Consider left and right of the decimal point separately.
   The stuff to the left can be converted to binary as before.
   Use the following algorithm to convert the fraction:

   fraction  fraction x 2  digit left of point
     .8          1.6              1 <-- most significant (f  )
     .6          1.2              1                        -1
     .2          0.4              0
     .4          0.8              0
     .8  (it must repeat from here!)

            ----
    .8 is  .1100



NON-BINARY FRACTIONS
--------------------

same as with binary, only the base changes!

       f     f    .  .  .   f    f    f  .  f    f    f  . . .
        n-1   n-2            2    1    0     -1   -2   -3
                                         |  
                                         |  
					  radix point

       The decimal value is calculated in the same way as for
       non-fractional numbers,  the exponents are now negative.




  example:
          101.001 (octal)
          1 x 8**2 + 1 x 8**0 + 1 x 8**-3
             64     +    1     +  1/512
                   65  1/512  = 65.0019 (approx)

          13.a6 (hexadecimal)
	  1 x 16**1 + 3 x 16**0 + a x 16**-1 + 6 x 16**-2
	     16     +    3      +  10/16     +  6/256
		  19  166/256 = 19.64 (approx)

On accuracy, significant digits and precision
---------------------------------------------

   These terms are often used incorrectly or ignored.  They are
   important!

   Accuracy:

   A measurement (in a scientific experiment) implies a certain
   amount of error, depending on equipment used.  

   If measure the distance between two building with

   advanced instrument:	106.1345 meters +/- 0.003 (3 mm)
   by walking:		 98 meters +/- 15 meters

   "accuracy" is the difference between your measurement and
   the true, usually unknown, value.

   the +/- says you expect the true value to be within the interval

   98 meters +/- 15 meters ==> [83, 113] meters

   say you also measured the distance from the 1st building to
   the sidewalk of the 2nd:  72 +/- 8 = [64, 80]

   say you want the distance from the sidewalk to the 2nd building

   subtracting yields: [83, 113] - [64, 80] = [83-80, 113-64]
		= [3, 49] = 26 +/- 23  bogus!!!

   need to measure distance from sidewalk to 2nd bldg directly!!

   would be okay with advanced instrument

   
   
   Significant Digits:
   
   they tell about accuracy by approx interval.

   For example, a number given as
    3.6  really implies that this number is in the range of
	 3.6 +- .05,   which is 3.55 to 3.65
	 This is 2 significant digits.
    3.60 really implies that this number is in the range of
	 3.6 +- .005,   which is 3.595 to 3.605
	 This is 3 significant digits.
    
   So, the number of significant digits given in a number tells
   about how accurately the number is known. The larger the number
   of significant digits, the better the accuracy.



   Precision:

   Computers (or calculators, a more familiar machine) have a fixed
   precision.  No matter what accuracy of a number is known, they
   give lots of digits in an number.  They ignore how many significant
   digits are involved.
   For example, if you do the operation 1.2  x  2.2. given that
      each number has 2 significant digits, a correct answer is
		  
		  1.2
		x 2.2
		-----
		   24
		+ 24
		-----
		  264 --> 2.64  -->   2.6   or 2.6 +- .05

      a calculator will most likely give an answer of 2.640000000,
      which implies an accuracy much higher than possible.  The
      result given is just the highest precision that the calculator
      has.  It has no knowledge of accuracy -- only precision.

      Area of a circle is pi x radius**2
      pi = 3.14159265...
      radius = 8.3 meters

      Area = 81.91771634183238675...  WRONG!
      Area = 82 meters 


   Recall building and sidewalk example

   Computers make the problem even worse, because they can do millions
   of calculations, where

   (1) they can do millions of calculations and you don't look at or
   think about each calculation

   (2) the computers can print results with many digits -- but precision
   does not imply accuracy

   (3) you believe a computer's result too much -- they don't make
   mistakes, right?
